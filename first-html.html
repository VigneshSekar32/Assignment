<p> <strong>Photography</strong> is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a <strong> sensor or film</strong>, to create an image. With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.</p>
<P><strong>The first permanent photograph </strong>was captured in 1826 <strong> sources say 1827</strong> by <strong>Joseph Nicéphore Niépce </strong>in France. It shows the roof of a building lit by the sun. You can see it reproduced below:</P>
<p><strong>Color photography </strong>started to become popular and accessible with the release of <em>Eastman Kodak </em>“Kodachrome” film in the 1930s. Before that, almost all photos were monochromatic – although a handful of photographers, toeing the line between chemists and alchemists, had been using specialized techniques to capture color images for decades before. You’ll find some fascinating galleries of photos from the 1800s or early 1900s captured in full color, worth exploring if you have not seen them already.</p> 
<p>These <strong>scientist-magicians</strong> the first color photographers, are hardly alone in pushing the boundaries of one of the worlds newest art forms. The history of photography has always been a history of people – artists and inventors who steered the field into the modern era.</p> <hr>

<p><strong>Technology</strong>is the continually developing result of accumulated knowledge and application in all techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in industrial production and scientific research. Technology is embedded in the operation of all machines, with or without detailed knowledge of their function, for the intended purpose of an organization</p>
